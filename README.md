Hi, Welcome to my Bioinformatics Practice Repository. This is where I post the code I've been working on when I remember. 
I've primarily been coding using Python 3 using Jupyter Notebooks to solve Rosalind problems in-between spending time on learning through Udemy courses.
As this is for my own benefit my code has a lot of notes in it, mostly to explain to myself what everything does if I need to revisit it or to reinforce my knowledge.
If you're reading this it probably means you are either one of my friends or co-workers who has helped me, if so thank you, I appreciate your help immensely.
