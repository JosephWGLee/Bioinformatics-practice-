# a code to find the solution of how many rabbits are produced given two variables of month and how many pairs each rabbit litter produces
# this was to try and learn dynamic programming and using functions. I found it very challenging 
#for the print statement the first value is months an the second is pairs
#could improve this using memoization 

def Fibonacci_Loop(months, babies): #defining my function with a for loop two variables months and babies
    parent, kid = 1 ,1 
    for int in range(months - 1):
        kid, parent = parent, parent + (kid * babies) #fibonacci algorithm 
    return kid
print (Fibonacci_Loop(33, 3))
